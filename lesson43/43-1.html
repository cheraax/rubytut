  <h3>Imagine what you could build if you learned Ruby on Rails…</h3>
  <p>Ruby on Rails makes it much easier and more fun. It includes everything you need to build fantastic applications, and you can learn it with the support of our large, friendly community.</p>
  <div class="note">You’ve probably already used many of the applications that were built with Ruby on Rails: Basecamp, GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, Twitch, SoundCloud, Hulu, Zendesk, Square, Highrise.

  <h3>Ruby on Rails is open source software,</h3>
